### step1: Use an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's embedding API) to convert customer input into a vector representation.


import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Embedding.create(
    input="customer input text",
    model="text-embedding-ada-002"
)
embedding = response['data'][0]['embedding']

###Step2: Use the generated embedding to query your vector database and find the most similar embeddings.Pinecone is a specialized vector database designed to handle vector embeddings efficiently. It is particularly useful for applications involving AI, such as natural language processing, semantic search, and recommendation systems.


import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key='your-pinecone-api-key', environment='us-west1-gcp')

index = pinecone.Index('your-index-name')
results = index.query(embedding, top_k=5)

### step3: Use the results from the query to retrieve the most relevant responses from your database.

for match in results['matches']:
    print(f"ID: {match['id']}, Score: {match['score']}")
    # Retrieve the response associated with match['id'] from your database
