Vectorization: Turning Data into Numbers
Vectorization is the process of converting data into these numerical representations (vectors). In natural language processing, this often involves turning words or phrases into dense vectors of floating-point numbers. These vectors are designed to capture semantic meaning, allowing machines to process and compare text in a more nuanced way than simple string matching.
